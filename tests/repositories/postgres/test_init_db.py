"""Tests for ``_ensure_schema_loaded`` and ``init_db`` (AC #4, #5, #6, #7, #16).

Contains two groups:

* **Unit tests** that don't need a Postgres container — spy on
  ``Schema.default.load_toml`` to assert ``_ensure_schema_loaded`` runs the
  load exactly once, and grep the repo stubs to confirm ``init_db`` is not
  called from constructors.
* **Integration tests** that use the session-scoped ``postgres_initialized``
  fixture to exercise ``init_db`` against a real container, including an
  idempotency pass.
