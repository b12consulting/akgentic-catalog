"""Ref-sentinel constants, allowlist loader, and the v2 resolver pipeline.

This module owns the v2 ref-sentinel sentinel keys (``REF_KEY``, ``TYPE_KEY``)
and the ``load_model_type(path)`` function that imports a Pydantic
``BaseModel`` class by dotted path, gated behind three defensive checks:

1. The path must start with one of the prefixes returned by
   ``akgentic.catalog.allowlist.allowed_prefixes`` (storage + runtime defence
   in depth — ``models.entry.AllowlistedPath`` reads the same policy at
   Pydantic construction time, so the two enforcement points cannot drift).
2. The resolved class must be a subclass of ``pydantic.BaseModel``.
3. The resolved class must not declare Pydantic fields named ``__ref__`` or
   ``__type__`` (the reserved keys used by the resolver's sentinel scheme —
   collisions would break round-tripping).

It also exposes the v2 resolver pipeline built on top of those primitives:

* :func:`populate_refs` — recursive ref replacement with cycle, missing-target,
  and ``__type__`` mismatch detection; namespace-bounded. Ref-marker positions
  resolve to typed Pydantic instances of the referenced entry's ``model_type``
  (Story 15.6) so polymorphic fields (``list[ToolCard]``, ``list[type]``,
  …) validate against concrete subclasses without authoring workarounds.

  A ref-marker dict may additionally carry non-reserved sibling keys next to
  ``__ref__`` / ``__type__``. Those siblings are treated as a **shallow
  override** (top-level ``dict.update`` semantics) merged on top of the
  resolved target payload before validation (Story 20.1 / ADR-010). This
  lets a single shared ``BaseModel`` entry (notably ``PromptTemplate``) be
  reused by many callers, each supplying its own field values without
  duplicating the full target payload subtree.
* :func:`reconcile_refs` — walks input + dumped trees in lockstep to preserve
  author-written ref markers against a Pydantic-dumped payload. Sibling
  overrides on a ref marker round-trip verbatim: the dict returned for a
  ref-marker node is the full author-written dict, siblings included.
* :func:`resolve` — full hydration of an ``Entry`` into a runtime ``BaseModel``.
* :func:`prepare_for_write` — five-step write pipeline producing the
  intent-preserving, ref-preserving stored payload.
* :func:`validate_delete` — inbound-ref guard that returns a list of
  human-readable blocker messages (empty list = safe to delete).

``check_ownership`` is deliberately NOT part of this module — Story 15.5 is the
right place to decide whether ownership enforcement lives inside
``prepare_for_write`` or inside the ``Catalog`` service itself.

    """Recursively replace ref markers in ``node`` with their resolved payloads.

    Walks the payload tree. A dict with a ``REF_KEY`` (``"__ref__"``) entry is
    treated as a ref marker and replaced by a **typed Pydantic instance** built
    from the target entry's declared ``model_type`` (Story 15.6); ordinary
    dicts and lists recurse structurally; every other value is returned
    unchanged. The ``namespace`` is forwarded as-is to every recursive call —
    cross-namespace resolution is structurally impossible at runtime.

    Return-type note (Story 15.6): nodes that are **not** ref markers still
    return structurally as ``dict | list | leaf``. Only ref-marker positions
    become ``BaseModel`` instances. Downstream ``cls.model_validate(...)`` calls
    accept nested Pydantic instances where a field's declared annotation is
    the instance's base class (Pydantic v2 behaviour), so the return-type
    widening is compatible with every existing caller (``resolve``,
    ``prepare_for_write``, ``validation._check_transient_validation``).

    Sibling overrides (Story 20.1 / ADR-010): a ref-marker dict may carry
    non-reserved sibling keys alongside ``__ref__`` / ``__type__``. Those
    siblings are read as a **shallow override** (top-level ``dict.update``
    semantics) and merged on top of the resolved target payload before the
    target's ``model_type`` validates the result. The merge is shallow — a
    sibling ``params: {role: "Manager"}`` **replaces** the target's
    ``params`` entirely rather than recursing into it. Override values may
    themselves be ref markers; they are resolved recursively with the same
    cycle-detection set as any other nested ref. If the ref marker has no
    non-reserved siblings, the resolver's behaviour is observationally
    identical to the pre-20.1 baseline.

    Args:
        node: Arbitrary payload subtree (dict, list, or leaf value).
        repository: Entry repository used to resolve refs in ``namespace``.
        namespace: The namespace used for every repository lookup in this call.
        _visiting: Internal cycle-detection set of ``(namespace, target_id)``
            pairs already traversed on the current ref chain. Callers pass
            ``None`` (the default); the function builds a fresh set per call.
        is_namespace_shareable: Optional callable answering "is this namespace
            cross-namespace-referenceable?". The resolver invokes it for every
            cross-ns marker — when it returns ``False`` (or when the argument
            is ``None``), the marker is rejected with the substring
            ``"is not shareable"``. Same-namespace refs bypass the gate. Per
            ADR-008 §D2 (updated 2026-05-08 rev 2) the canonical implementation
            consults the target namespace's ``_meta`` entry and answers
            ``True`` iff ``payload["shareable"] is True`` (typed bool at the
            root, strict-bool comparison). Default ``None`` ⇒ no namespace
            is shareable (cross-ns refs unconditionally rejected).

    Returns:
        A new payload subtree with every ref marker replaced by a typed
        Pydantic instance of the referenced entry's ``model_type``. Dict and
        list inputs are never mutated — fresh containers are built for every
        recursion.

    (Story 20.1 / ADR-010), ``load_model_type`` on the target's declared
    ``model_type``, and ``cls.model_validate`` to build a typed instance.

    Order rationale: the shareable-flag gate fires BEFORE the repository
    lookup so a denied cross-ns ref produces the ``"is not shareable"`` error
    even when the target id genuinely does not exist (ADR-008 §D2 —
    denying access takes precedence over reporting "not found"). Cycle
    comes next because the cross-ns target may be visited along a chain we

    follow.

    Sibling-override semantics (ADR-010): any keys on ``node`` other than
    ``__ref__`` / ``__type__`` / ``__namespace__`` are collected as

    recursive descent into shared subkeys — and runs before
    ``cls.model_validate``. When the ref marker has no non-reserved
    siblings, this branch is skipped entirely.

    ADR-017: once ``cls`` is loaded, every override key that is not a field of

    re-read, including its override values.
