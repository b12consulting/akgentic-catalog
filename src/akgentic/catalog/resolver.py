"""Ref-sentinel constants, allowlist loader, and the v2 resolver pipeline.

The v2 ref-sentinel keys (``REF_KEY``, ``TYPE_KEY``, ``NAMESPACE_KEY``) are
defined in :mod:`akgentic.catalog.refs` and re-exported here, which is the
import path every consumer in this package still uses. This module owns
the ``load_model_type(path)`` function that imports a Pydantic
``BaseModel`` class by dotted path, gated behind three defensive checks:

1. The path must start with one of the prefixes returned by
   ``akgentic.catalog.allowlist.allowed_prefixes`` (storage + runtime defence
   in depth — ``models.entry.AllowlistedPath`` reads the same policy at
   Pydantic construction time, so the two enforcement points cannot drift).
2. The resolved class must be a subclass of ``pydantic.BaseModel``.
3. The resolved class must not declare Pydantic fields named ``__ref__`` or
   ``__type__`` (the reserved keys used by the resolver's sentinel scheme —
   collisions would break round-tripping).

It also exposes the v2 resolver pipeline built on top of those primitives:

* :func:`populate_refs` — recursive ref replacement with cycle, missing-target,
  and ``__type__`` mismatch detection; namespace-bounded. Ref-marker positions
  resolve to typed Pydantic instances of the referenced entry's ``model_type``
  (Story 15.6) so polymorphic fields (``list[ToolCard]``, ``list[type]``,
  …) validate against concrete subclasses without authoring workarounds.

  A ref marker is a **pure pointer**: it carries ``__ref__`` and, optionally,
  ``__type__`` / ``__namespace__``. Any other key is a validation error. That
  makes a marker a leaf to every payload walker in this package — the one
  invariant those walkers used to disagree about. To share a value between
  entries, inline the payload and reference the shared part through a
  ``NativeValue`` entry.
* :func:`reconcile_refs` — walks input + dumped trees in lockstep to preserve
  author-written ref markers against a Pydantic-dumped payload. A marker
  round-trips verbatim; it has no interior to descend into.
* :func:`resolve` — full hydration of an ``Entry`` into a runtime ``BaseModel``.
* :func:`prepare_for_write` — five-step write pipeline producing the
  intent-preserving, ref-preserving stored payload.
* :func:`validate_delete` — inbound-ref guard that returns a list of
  human-readable blocker messages (empty list = safe to delete).

``check_ownership`` is deliberately NOT part of this module — Story 15.5 is the
right place to decide whether ownership enforcement lives inside
``prepare_for_write`` or inside the ``Catalog`` service itself.

    Walks the payload tree. A dict with a ``REF_KEY`` (``"__ref__"``) entry is

    from the target entry's declared ``model_type`` (Story 15.6); ordinary
    dicts and lists recurse structurally; every other value is returned
    unchanged. The ``namespace`` is forwarded as-is to every recursive call —
    cross-namespace resolution is structurally impossible at runtime.

    Return-type note (Story 15.6): nodes that are **not** ref markers still
    return structurally as ``dict | list | leaf``. Only ref-marker positions
    become ``BaseModel`` instances. Downstream ``cls.model_validate(...)`` calls
    accept nested Pydantic instances where a field's declared annotation is
    the instance's base class (Pydantic v2 behaviour), so the return-type
    widening is compatible with every existing caller (``resolve``,
    ``prepare_for_write``, ``validation._check_transient_validation``).

    A ref marker is a pure pointer: it carries ``__ref__`` and, optionally,
    ``__type__`` / ``__namespace__``. Any other key raises. To share a value
    between entries, inline the payload and reference the shared part through
    a ``NativeValue`` entry, which resolves to the bare scalar at the splice
    site.

    Args:
        node: Arbitrary payload subtree (dict, list, or leaf value).
        repository: Entry repository used to resolve refs in ``namespace``.
        namespace: The namespace used for every repository lookup in this call.
        _visiting: Internal cycle-detection set of ``(namespace, target_id)``
            pairs already traversed on the current ref chain. Callers pass
            ``None`` (the default); the function builds a fresh set per call.
        is_namespace_shareable: Optional callable answering "is this namespace
            cross-namespace-referenceable?". The resolver invokes it for every
            cross-ns marker — when it returns ``False`` (or when the argument
            is ``None``), the marker is rejected with the substring
            ``"is not shareable"``. Same-namespace refs bypass the gate. Per
            ADR-008 §D2 (updated 2026-05-08 rev 2) the canonical implementation
            consults the target namespace's ``_meta`` entry and answers
            ``True`` iff ``payload["shareable"] is True`` (typed bool at the
            root, strict-bool comparison). Default ``None`` ⇒ no namespace
            is shareable (cross-ns refs unconditionally rejected).

    Returns:
        A new payload subtree with every ref marker replaced by a typed
        Pydantic instance of the referenced entry's ``model_type``. Dict and

    """Restore ref markers from ``input_node`` against a dumped Pydantic tree.

    The dumped tree (from ``obj.model_dump(mode='python', exclude_unset=True)``)
    is the authority for every non-ref field — it carries validator-normalised
    values. Author-written ref markers in ``input_node`` must win verbatim so
    that the stored payload round-trips back to itself when re-resolved.

    A ref-marker dict is returned verbatim as a whole — this function never
    recurses into it, because a marker is a leaf: it carries only ``__ref__``
    and the optional ``__type__`` / ``__namespace__`` sentinels, and the
    resolver refuses any other key. The stored payload therefore resolves to
    the same in-memory shape when re-read.

    Keys absent from the dumped tree are still dropped here: ``prepare_for_write``
    now refuses them one step earlier (ADR-017), so this stays as the defence
    for callers that bypass it.

    Args:
        input_node: The original payload subtree the author wrote (may carry
            ``REF_KEY`` markers, each carrying only the reserved sentinels).
        dumped_node: The corresponding subtree from ``model_dump``.

    Returns:
        A reconciled subtree: ref markers preserved verbatim from ``input_node``,
        non-ref dict keys recursed pairwise, list elements zipped pairwise with
        strict length, and leaves taken from ``dumped_node``. Neither input
        tree is mutated.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``input_node`` and ``dumped_node`` are both lists but of
            mismatched lengths (``zip(..., strict=True)`` raises).
