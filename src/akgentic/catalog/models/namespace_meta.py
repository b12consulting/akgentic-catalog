"""Namespace-metadata payload model — backs ``EntryKind="meta"`` entries.

This module exposes a single Pydantic ``BaseModel`` (:class:`NamespaceMeta`)
used as the payload-validation class for the ``kind="meta"`` catalog entry
introduced by ADR-008 §D1. The model carries four pinned fields — ``name``,
``description``, a free-form ``properties`` map, and a typed ``shared``
boolean — so the namespace picker reads tenant-level metadata from a stable,
purpose-built shape instead of leaking ``TeamCard``'s schema.

Key exports:

* :class:`NamespaceMeta` — the payload model. Plain ``BaseModel`` (not
  ``SerializableBaseModel``) — catalog payload models are not actor messages.

The model is reachable via the ``model_type=
"akgentic.catalog.models.namespace_meta.NamespaceMeta"`` allowlist used by
:func:`akgentic.catalog.resolver.load_model_type`. No resolver / allowlist
change is required by this story; the existing ``akgentic.*`` prefix already
covers it.

    """Payload model for the per-namespace metadata entry (``kind="meta"``).

    Four pinned fields, in declaration order:

    * ``name`` — required non-empty display name for the namespace; surfaced
      by ``GET /catalog/namespaces`` to feed the picker.
    * ``description`` — optional human-readable description; defaults to
      empty string.
    * ``properties`` — free-form ``str -> str`` annotations carrying
      tenant-level metadata (display tier, owner team, custom labels) that
      should NOT pollute :class:`~akgentic.team.models.TeamCard`. The map is
      fully free-form: there are NO catalog-reserved keys. Both keys and
      values are strings.
    * ``shared`` — typed boolean controlling cross-namespace
      referenceability (ADR-008 §D2 as updated 2026-05-08, rev 2). When
      ``True``, the namespace is cross-namespace-referenceable as a target —
      other namespaces may carry refs into this one (subject to the existing
      ``user_id is None`` ownership gate). When ``False`` (the default), the
      namespace is not shared. Pydantic strict-mode rejects non-bool inputs
      so operators must opt in unambiguously with a real boolean.

    Convention id is ``"_meta"``; the route fallback in
    ``GET /catalog/namespaces`` reads ``payload["name"]`` /
    ``description`` from the meta entry and falls back to the team entry
    otherwise (so existing deployments continue to work without explicit
    backfill — see ADR-008 §D1).

    The model is plain ``BaseModel`` per architecture §D6 — catalog payload
    models are validated configuration, not actor messages, so the
    ``SerializableBaseModel`` machinery is intentionally NOT inherited.
