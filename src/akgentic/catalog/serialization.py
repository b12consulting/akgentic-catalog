"""Namespace-bundle YAML serialization for the catalog v2 service.

This module owns the single-bundle YAML format defined in architecture shard 09:
an entire user or enterprise namespace serialised as one self-contained YAML
document with document-level ``namespace`` + ``user_id`` (and optional header
projection — ``name`` / ``description`` / ``properties`` — hoisted from the
namespace's ``_meta`` entry) plus per-entry fields nested under ``entries.<id>``.

Story 17.6 — the wire format is the pre-17.5 dict-keyed shape extended with:

* Top-level ``name`` / ``description`` / ``properties`` (header projection).
* Per-kind external sections inside ``entries:`` keyed by composite ``<ns>.<id>``
  for cross-namespace targets (collected upstream by
  :meth:`Catalog._collect_external_refs`).

The module exposes two pure functions:

* :func:`dump_namespace` — serialise ``list[Entry]`` (+ optional header +
  optional external refs) to YAML ``str``.
* :func:`load_namespace` — parse YAML ``str`` into ``(list[Entry], BundleHeader)``.

The module is repository-agnostic: neither function performs repository I/O,
runs ``prepare_for_write``, or mutates any catalog state. The service-level
``Catalog.export_namespace_yaml`` / ``import_namespace_yaml`` methods own the
repository boundary; this module owns only the wire format.

``load_namespace`` is deliberately kept pure (no ``prepare_for_write``) so
``Catalog.validate_namespace_yaml`` can reuse it in-process for dry-run
validation of proposed bundles.

class BundleHeader(NamespaceMeta):
    """The namespace's metadata as it arrives on the wire, plus ``present``.

    The header IS the namespace metadata — it carries exactly the fields of
    :class:`~akgentic.catalog.models.namespace_meta.NamespaceMeta` and gains
    them by inheritance, so the header's *declaration* never drifts from the
    meta model's (ADR-020 §D3).

    That covers the declaration and the accepted key set only. Two hand-
    maintained lists still stand between a new meta field and a working round
    trip, and BOTH must be updated in the same commit that adds the field:
    :func:`_project_header` reads the header keys off the parsed document one
    by one, and :func:`dump_namespace` takes them as explicit keyword
    arguments. Miss either and the field is accepted at the root (the key set
    is derived) and then silently dropped — no error, no failed test.
    Widening those two is out of this story's scope, deliberately; this note
    is what keeps the gap visible until it is closed.

    Two fields are its own:

    * ``name`` — **relaxed** back to ``str = ""``. The meta model requires a
      non-empty name; a bundle need not carry a ``name:`` key at all, and
      :func:`_project_header` must stay infallible, so the header accepts the
      empty string. The non-empty contract is enforced where it belongs — the
      import path re-validates the header through ``NamespaceMeta`` and
      aborts before any repository write when the name is empty.
    * ``present`` — ``True`` iff at least one header key was explicitly set in
      the source YAML. Pre-17.5 bundles (no header fields at all) parse to
      ``present=False`` so the import handler can skip the meta upsert
      entirely and leave an existing ``_meta`` untouched.

    ``present`` is a parse signal, not namespace metadata: it is excluded when
    the header is projected back onto a ``NamespaceMeta``, and it is NOT a
    legal bundle root key (see :data:`_BUNDLE_ROOT_KEYS`).

    """Serialise a uniform-namespace list of entries to bundle YAML.

    The output document carries up to eight top-level keys in declaration
    order: ``namespace``, ``user_id``, ``name``, ``description``,
    ``properties``, ``shareable``, ``public``, ``entries``. The header
    (Story 17.7 added ``shareable`` after ``properties``; Story 18.2 adds
    ``public`` after ``shareable``) is emitted ONLY when at least one of
    the six optional parameters forces it: ``name`` is non-empty,
    ``description`` is non-empty, ``properties`` is non-empty, ``shareable``
    is ``True``, ``public`` is ``True``, or ``external_refs`` is non-empty.
    When all six parameters are at their default values, the function emits
    the pre-17.5 wire shape verbatim (three top-level keys: ``namespace``,
    ``user_id``, ``entries``) so legacy callers see no behaviour change.

    Each value under ``entries`` is keyed either by the entry id (local) or
    by the composite ``<entry.namespace>.<entry.id>`` (external). Local values
    map to four per-entry fields in declaration order: ``kind``, ``model_type``,
    ``description``, ``payload``. The ``id``, ``namespace`` and ``user_id``
    fields are NOT duplicated inside the per-entry maps — they are implied by
    the document context and the outer key.

    Ownership invariant: every entry in ``entries`` MUST share the same
    ``user_id`` (a real string after Story 18.1 — ``"anonymous"`` for
    community-tier exports; the authenticated caller's identifier on
    department / enterprise tier).
    Namespace invariant: every entry MUST share the same ``namespace``.
    Both invariants are checked together before emit; violations raise
    ``CatalogValidationError`` with one message per offender.

    ``payload`` values pass through verbatim — ref markers (``__ref__`` /
    ``__type__``) are preserved unchanged. ``dump_namespace`` does NOT
    re-resolve, re-validate, or re-reconcile; stored payloads are already
    intent-preserving.

    Local entries are emitted in a stable order grouped by kind in
    consumption order — ``team`` → ``meta`` → ``agent`` → ``prompt`` →
    ``tool`` → ``model`` — and within each kind sorted by ``id``
    (lexicographic). External sections emit AFTER all local kinds, in pre-17.5
    kind order (team → agent → prompt → tool → model — no meta), each
    section sorted by ``(namespace, id)`` ascending.

    Args:
        entries: Non-empty list of ``Entry`` instances sharing a single
            namespace and user_id.
        name: Optional namespace display name (header projection from
            ``_meta.payload`` with team-payload fallback). Default ``""``
            suppresses the header.
        description: Optional namespace description. Default ``""``.
        properties: Optional namespace properties mapping. Default ``None``
            is treated as empty.
        external_refs: Optional list of cross-namespace target entries. When
            non-empty, emit per-kind external sections inside ``entries:``
            using composite ``<ns>.<id>`` keys.

    Returns:
        A YAML document string produced via ``yaml.dump`` with
        ``sort_keys=False``, ``allow_unicode=True``, and
        ``default_flow_style=False``, post-processed to add section headers
        and blank-line separators.

    Raises:
        CatalogValidationError: When ``entries`` is empty, or when any

    Story 17.6 — the parser is structurally strict: the root must be a
    ``dict`` with ``namespace`` (non-empty ``str``), ``user_id`` (non-empty
    ``str``; legacy ``null`` is accepted on read and rewritten to
    ``"anonymous"`` per Story 18.1), and ``entries`` (non-empty ``dict``).
    Optional top-level fields ``name`` (``str``), ``description`` (``str``),
    ``properties`` (``dict[str, str]``), ``shareable`` (``bool``), and
    ``public`` (``bool``) are projected into the returned
    :class:`BundleHeader`. Any missing or wrong-typed required key
    accumulates into a single ``CatalogValidationError`` — the error list
    is NOT short-circuited after the first failure so frontends can render
    every issue in one pass.

    ADR-017 — both key sets are closed on read as well as on emit: a root key
    outside ``_BUNDLE_ROOT_KEYS`` and a local entry-map key outside
    ``_ENTRY_MAP_KEYS`` are rejected, accumulating into that same one-pass
    error list. Before this, a misprinted ``sharable:`` left the namespace
    silently un-shareable and a misprinted ``descriptin:`` reset the entry's
    description to ``""``.

    Each ``(entry_key, entry_map)`` pair under ``entries:`` is split on the
    FIRST ``.`` to decide local vs. external:

    * Key contains no ``.`` → local entry. The handler constructs an ``Entry``
      with ``id=key``, ``namespace=<doc namespace>``, ``user_id=<doc user_id>``.
    * Key contains at least one ``.`` → external entry (cross-namespace
      target). The handler **SKIPS** it entirely (the import path treats
      external entries as readonly display projection — they belong to other
      namespaces and are not part of this namespace's atomic-replace contents).

    A bundle whose ``entries:`` block is a YAML list (the rejected Story 17.5
    wire shape) raises ``CatalogValidationError`` with an explicit message —
    the field-shape is unambiguous, so an explicit error is preferable to
    silent degradation.

    The function is parse-only: it does NOT call ``prepare_for_write``, does
    NOT touch a repository, and does NOT persist anything.

    Args:
        yaml_text: The full bundle YAML document as a string.

        the :class:`BundleHeader` projection of the optional top-level
        header trio (``present=False`` when none of the three header fields
        appears in the source).

    Raises:
        CatalogValidationError: On malformed YAML, structural failures,

            failures.

    not read here never reaches an imported namespace, however legal its key
    is at the bundle root — see :class:`BundleHeader`.

    Story 17.7 added ``shareable`` to the projected fields; Story 18.2 adds
    ``public``. Defensive parsing: a missing key projects to ``False``; a
    non-bool value also projects to ``False`` (Pydantic strict-mode at the
